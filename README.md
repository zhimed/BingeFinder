# TvShowsDB
Responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website was built using the previously mentioned technologies and an API that returns tv shows in the JSON 
format based on requests. The user can search tv shows by name and the results will be displayed below with pictures/posters of each show. This is the first iteration 
of this website in its simpler form, as the next will give the user the ability to click the poster and be directed to another custom webpage showing the show in much greater 
detail.
