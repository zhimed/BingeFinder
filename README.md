# BingeFinder
Responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website was built using the previously mentioned technologies and a third party API that gives access to tv shows in JSON 
format. The user can search tv shows by name and the results will be displayed with pictures/posters of each show. The user now has the ability to click on any poster and be directed to another custom webpage showing the show in much greater 
detail. The rating, language, genre, and more will be shown on the page the user is directed to.
